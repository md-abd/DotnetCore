Asp.Net Core is one of the best technologies in the software market.

The project uses the MVC architecture. This shows the flow of data between the model, view and the controller.
The HttpGet attribute responds to the 'GET' request and gets the data from the server.
The HttpPost attribute responds to the 'POST' request and posts the data to the server.
